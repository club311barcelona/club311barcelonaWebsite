## 3. Technical Specifications
### 3.1. Architecture
The website will be built using a modern web application architecture, leveraging a combination of frontend and backend technologies. The frontend will be a React application, and the backend will be handled by a serverless architecture.

### 3.2. Technologies Used
#### 3.2.1. Frontend
*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Justification: Component-based architecture, efficient updates, large community support.
*   **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript. Justification: Improved code maintainability, early error detection, enhanced developer experience.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework. Justification: Rapid UI development, consistent styling, responsive design. The new components from 21st.dev will be styled using Tailwind CSS classes to match the existing design system. This will involve mapping existing design tokens to the appropriate Tailwind classes.
*   **Vite:** A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. Justification: Fast development server, optimized builds. The new components will be optimized for Vite's development server through code splitting, lazy loading, and efficient asset handling.

#### 3.2.2. Backend
*   **Serverless Functions (e.g., Vercel Functions, Netlify Functions):** For handling API requests, form submissions, and other backend logic. Justification: Scalability, cost-effectiveness, ease of deployment.
*   **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment. Justification: Consistent language across frontend and backend.

#### 3.2.3. Database
*   **Supabase (or similar):** A PostgreSQL database with a real-time API. Justification: Easy setup, real-time capabilities, robust data management.

#### 3.2.4. Component Library
*   **21st.dev:** Component library providing pre-built, responsive, and type-safe React components. Justification: Rapid UI development, consistent design, improved performance. The components will be integrated into the existing codebase, replacing the current implementations. TypeScript interfaces will be used to ensure type safety and maintainability.

#### 3.2.5. Other
*   **Git:** Version control system.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., Vercel, Netlify):** For automated deployments.

### 3.3. APIs and Integrations
